# NetSuite SDF Object Organiser

NetSuite SDF Object Organiser is a Visual Studio Code extension that helps you organise custom objects in your NetSuite SuiteCloud development projects. This extension allows you to group related objects into project folders, improving maintainability and structure when working with large customisation sets.

## üöÄ Features

- Detects if the current workspace is a valid NetSuite SDF project.
- Allows you to create a project folder within the `src/Objects` directory.
- Presents a multi-select list of available NetSuite object types.
- Group SDF XML files and move them into meaningful directories just by clicking a few buttons

## üì¶ Requirements

To use this extension, you must have:

- A valid NetSuite SuiteCloud project with the following in place:
  - `suitecloud.config.js` in the workspace root.
  - A `src` folder containing:
    - `deploy.xml`
    - `manifest.xml`
    - `Objects/` directory

If these files and folders are not found, the extension will show an error and abort the operation.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Extension Settings

This extension does not currently expose any configuration settings. Future versions may allow customizing object types, naming conventions, or output paths.

## üìù Latest Release

## 1.3.0 - New Commands!
- "Add Object Reference to Deploy File" & "Refresh Object References in Deploy File" commands are now available
- "Add Object Reference to Deploy File" allows users to select an XML file from their project to automatically add to the `deploy.xml` file. Once importing an object through the SuiteCloud Development Framework extension, use this command to quickly add the object reference!
- "Refresh Object References in Deploy File" allows users to ensure that the file path of the objects defined in the `deploy.xml` file are correct. Once organising your files, you can run this command to quickly update the file path if it has changed since adding to the file! This will also remove any object references that do not exist in your current project, making it easy to ensure that you are only referencing objects that actually exist.
